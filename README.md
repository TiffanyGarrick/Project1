# PROJECT 1
This Project is the individual project done by Tiffany Garrick (620118750).
 
A few things to note:
1. Added the Heroku URL to __init__.py as "SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL"
2. Attempted to run the migration but received a flask error that it was unknown, hence preventing the app from running altogether
3. A database was created called "project" regardless.
4. Concluding number 3 above, the overall issues hopefully should not decrease the work attempted.
